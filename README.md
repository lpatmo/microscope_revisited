###Notes about https://book.discovermeteor.com
- "A Meteor Method is a server-side function that is called client-side...Collection's insert, update and remove functions are all Methods."
- "Meteor method callbacks always have two arguments, error and result."

###Questions
- What's the difference between Meteor.method and Meteor.publish?
- So... functions placed in the /collections folder will be available to *both* the server and the client and run at the same time, right? If I'm building on top of Telescope, do I continue to develop here, or do I need to put my code in a separate package?
